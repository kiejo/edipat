edipat
======
I started this project to experiment with structural source code editing and the implementation of a Lisp dialect with pattern matching support.

Editor
---
Structural editor written in edipat which works directly on a tree representation of edipat source code. Supports autocompletion and detects undefined identifiers.  
Try it out online: http://kiejo.github.io/edipat

Language
---
* dialect of Lisp with pattern matching support
* compiles to JavaScript
* compiler written in JavaScript.
* no macros yet

Why a new language?
* for fun and learning
* to be able to test what language constructs work well with structural editing
* haven't seen any Lisp dialect with native pattern matching
