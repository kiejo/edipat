edipat
======
I started this project to experiment with structural source code editing and the implementation of a Lisp dialect with pattern matching support.

Editor
---
Structural editor written in edipat which works directly on a tree representation of edipat source code. Supports autocompletion and detects undefined identifiers.  
Try it out online: http://kiejo.github.io/edipat

Language
---
Dialact of Lisp with pattern matching supportcompiles to JavaScript. The compiler is written in JavaScript and there's no macro support yet.  
I created the language mainly for fun and to see what works well with structural editing.
